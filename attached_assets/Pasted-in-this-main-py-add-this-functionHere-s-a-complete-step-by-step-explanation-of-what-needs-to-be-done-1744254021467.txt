in this main.py add this functionHere's a complete step-by-step explanation of what needs to be done to fix all the issues:

Understanding the Current Problems:

Free users can bypass /start and use commands directly in private chat

Premium restrictions aren't being enforced properly

Group restrictions aren't working correctly

Multiple responses for single commands

Buttons not working properly

Required Telegram IDs (You Need to Provide/Set These):

OWNER_ID = 1805944073

ADMIN_IDS = [List of admin user IDs]

PREMIUM_GROUP_ID = -1001510453323 (your checking group)

OFFICIAL_GROUP = -1001510453323 (same as above)

CHANNEL_ID = Your channel ID where users must join

Solution Architecture:
We need to implement 4 layers of verification:

Layer 1: User Type Verification

Owner (full access everywhere)

Admins (full access everywhere)

Premium users (access in private + group)

Free users (group only)

Layer 2: Chat Type Verification

Private chats: Only owner/admins/premium

Group chats: Only your official group

Other groups: Block completely

Layer 3: Command Verification

/start - available to all

/register - available to all

All other commands - restricted

Layer 4: Persistent Verification

Store premium users in premium_users.txt

Store registered users in registered_users.txt

Verify at EVERY command execution

Step-by-Step Implementation:

Step 1: Create Necessary Files

premium_users.txt (for premium user IDs)

registered_users.txt (for registered users)

config.py (to store all IDs)

Step 2: User Flow Implementation

For Private Chats:

User sends any message

Bot checks:

Is user owner/admin? ‚Üí Allow

Is user in premium_users.txt? ‚Üí Allow

Else ‚Üí Show "Join group" message

For Group Chats:

Check if group is OFFICIAL_GROUP

If yes ‚Üí Allow free users

If no ‚Üí Show "Join official group" message

Step 3: Command Handling
Every command must:

Check chat type (private/group)

Check user status (owner/admin/premium/free)

Check command permissions

Verify group membership if free user

Step 4: Error Handling
Show specific messages:

"‚ùóÔ∏è Premium required for private use"

"üåü Join our group: [link]"

"üìõ Unauthorized group - use official group"

Required Changes:

In config.py:

python
Copy
OWNER_ID = 12345678 # Your ID
ADMIN_IDS = [12345678] # Your admin IDs
PREMIUM_GROUP_ID = -1001510453323
OFFICIAL_GROUP = -1001510453323
CHANNEL_ID = -10012345678 # Your channel ID
BOT_USERNAME = "@yourbotusername"
Command Processing Flow:

When any message received:

Get user_id

Get chat_id

Check if command is allowed

Verify access rights

Process or reject

Premium Verification:

Before processing any command:

python
Copy
if chat_type == "private" and user not in premium_users:
   return "Join group or buy premium"
Final Setup Instructions:

Create these files:

premium_users.txt (add premium user IDs)

registered_users.txt (will auto-fill)

config.py (with your actual IDs)

Add these checks to EVERY command handler:

Private chat check

Premium user check

Group verification

For buttons:

Use proper reply_markup formatting

Ensure callback data is unique

Handle button presses separately

Testing Procedure:

As owner:

Test all commands in private

Test in group

As premium user:

Test private access

Verify group access

As free user:

Verify blocked in private

Verify allowed in group

Verify blocked in other groups

This complete solution will:

Block free users in private chats completely

Allow premium users private access

Restrict usage to only your official group

Prevent all bypass methods

Provide clear error messages

Remember to:

Replace all placeholder IDs with your actual IDs

Add your admin user IDs

Add premium users to premium_users.txt

Test thoroughly after implementation

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?

and also how user will get pemiume , owner and admin have cmds
/key quntitty of key  for how may days 
for example 
/key 1 30d


how user can redeem code 

/redeem with key 
for example 
/redeem kafka_plus_a5Qy0khds

and if admin or owner want to camncle any premiume user d the cmd

/dgrade reply/user_id



add this fix all and send me full fixed updated code
